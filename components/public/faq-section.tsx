      answer: 'At Vetted, we hold the deepest respect for every individual who has served. Our program is deliberately designed for combat veterans because our curriculum is built to translate the unique experiences of frontline service into a successful entrepreneurial career. First, we help combat veterans recognize and reframe the powerful skills they already possess. The ability to lead small teams, make critical decisions under extreme uncertainty, risk analysis, and execute a mission with limited resources are the essence of entrepreneurship. Our training shows you how planning an operation is analogous to developing a market-entry strategy. Second, we bridge the skill gaps that often exist after years of operational focus. Frontline service builds incredible leaders, but it doesn\'t typically teach financial modeling, marketing analytics, or the art of effective storytelling and networking. Vetted provides targeted instruction in these crucial business fundamentals catered to the combat veteran. By limiting the cohort to veterans with a shared combat background, we create a high-trust environment built on mutual understanding. This fosters unparalleled peer support, allowing participants to not only build a business but also engage in a process of mutual growth and recovery.',
